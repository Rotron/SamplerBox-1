SamplerBox
==========

An open-source audio sampler project based on RaspberryPi.


[Modifications](#modifications)
----

This is a modified version of [Joseph Ernest's ](https://github.com/josephernest/SamplerBox) SamplerBox, as well as pieces from [Hans](http://homspace.xs4all.nl/homspace/samplerbox/index.html) and [Erik](http://www.nickyspride.nl/sb2/) (SamplerBox2).

The original samplerbox.py code was getting too big to manage so I have split it up into modules.
 
A menu system (Navigator) has been implemented to let the user change: the order of the setlist, master volume, system settings etc.

System .ini config files are also read and written. The plan is also to have MIDI mapping configs for any unique MIDI controller that is connected to the SamplerBox.
